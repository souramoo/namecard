# namecard
A digital namecard for me

- During COVID, it's hard to talk without SHOUTING when I've got an FFP3 mask on and people can't see half my face.
- Talking and seeing my face is important to introduce myself to new people.
- My name is hard to understand even when I'm shouting because I'm a BAME person and people aren't used to my name.
- I can pull out this namecard on my phone to help introduce myself.
- It's a progressive web app, that can be installed onto a phone (with offline support).
