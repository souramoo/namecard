# namecard
A digital namecard for me

- I'm working in ICU during COVID and it's hard to talk without SHOUTING when I've got an FFP3 mask on.
- Talking is important to introduce myself to new people
- My name is a bit hard to pronounce when I'm shouting
- I can pull out this namecard on my phone to help introduce myself
- It's a progressive web app, that can be installed onto a phone (with offline support)
